Hi Abel, here's how to get a tunnel into your AWS instance :D

can access the browser UI for Kubernetes now!
Need to setup an SSH tunnel in PuTTY
goto connection->SSH->Tunnels
in 'add a new forwarded port:' set source port, select dynamic and click add.
ATTENTION:
Don't have the PuTTY configuration panel open! it disables the tunnel D:

Then in browser:
For Firefox:
goto Settings->Advanced->Network->Connection
click settings and set 'Manual proxy configuration:'
Enter 'SOCKS Host:' as localhost on the port you configured PuTTY as.
(Might need to remove line about 'localhost' in 'No Proxy for' box)
